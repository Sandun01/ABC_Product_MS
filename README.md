### ABC Company â€“ Product Microservice

ABC Company sells a range of exclusive products across Sri Lanka online. In this existing system, 
my component is managing products. In this component, there are four main functionalities.

- Add Products
- View Products (Single by Id or All)
- Update Product Information
- Delete Product

Product microservice is an independent microservice that runs on the docker container. 
MongoDB is the database used in this microservice and it works on a separate MongoDB Atlas 
database. Finally, this microservice is connected to a CI/CD pipeline which works real time with 
the changes of the master branch of product service.
